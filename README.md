# Waterfall configs for ROEngines (work in progress)
Waterfall configs for ROEngines.
Zorg and Nertea are the authors of the used templates. Thanks to them. I only applied the templates to the engines. Also thanks to damonvv for the GeminiWhoop sound.
There are BDB_HTP_vernier.cfg, BDB_HTP_vernierVac.cfg and GeminiWhoop.ogg included. These files are from BDB. I did not modify them.
