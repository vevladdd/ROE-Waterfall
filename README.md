# ROE-Waterfall

**This is a development repo and should not be used unless you know what you're doing.**

Waterfall support is now provided by *master* RealismOverhaul, ROEngines, and ROCapsules. To use Waterfall plumes, update to the latest masters of these mods and install Waterfall Core (version 0.6.3 is required) from CKAN or the [forum page](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196309-*).

If you do want to use the development version, follow the instructions below:

<details>
<summary>Click to show manual installation instructions</summary>

**Please note that the latest version (as of 2021-04-16) moved several files. Delete the `GameData/ROEngines/Waterfall` and `GameData/RealismOverhaul/Waterfall_Configs` folders before updating.**

1. **If you have not done so, update to the latest *release* versions of RealismOverhaul (>= 13.0) and ROEngines (>= 1.7).**
2. **Install the latest version of Waterfall Core.**
   * ROE-Waterfall and Waterfall Core are two separate things. ROE-Waterfall provides configurations for Realism Overhaul engines, Waterfall Core provides the effects themselves. ROE-Waterfall is to Waterfall Core as RealPlume-Stock is to RealPlume. *You need both.*
3. Download this package: Press the green button "Code" and click on "Download ZIP".
4. Copy the `RealismOverhaul`, `ROEngines`, and `ROCapsules` folders from the zip file into `GameData` and *agree* to overwrite.
   1. The `Extras` folder, as the name indicates, is optional. Don't use it unless you know exactly what you need from it.
5. Launch the game.

## ROWaterfall Technical Documentation

ROWaterfall is a ModuleManager patchset used by RO to easily and uniformly apply Waterfall and audio effects to engines.

### Overview

ROWaterfall provides the `ROWaterfall` node to specify effects, an example of which is below:

```text
@PART[ROE-RD107]:BEFORE[ROWaterfall]:NEEDS[Waterfall]
{
    ROWaterfall
    {
        template = waterfall-kerolox-lower-1
        audio = pump-fed-heavy-1
        transform = RD-107A-MainFXTransform
        position = 0,0,0.48
        rotation = 0,0,0
        scale = 1.3,1.3,1.3
        glow = _yellow

        ExtraTemplate
        {
            template = waterfall-kerolox-vernier-2
            transform = RD-107A-VernierFXTransform
            position = 0,0,0.29
            rotation = 0,0,0
            scale = 2.5,2.5,2
        }
    }
}
```

ROWaterfall will produce a `Module[ModuleWaterfallFX]` node and an `EFFECTS` node from this patch.

Note that, by default, ROWaterfall **removes** all existing effects (stock, RealPlume, and handwritten Waterfall). However, is is still possible to [use ROWaterfall along with other effect providers](#using-other-effect-providers-in-conjunction-with-rowaterfall).

### Configuration Options

**There can only be one `ROWaterfall` node in each part.** If more complex plumes are needed, extra `ModuleWaterfallFX`es can be added [manually](#using-other-effect-providers-in-conjunction-with-rowaterfall).

An `ROWaterfall` node can contain the following keys and nodes:

| <div style='min-width: 9em;'>Key or node name</div> | Required | <div style='min-width: 6em;'>Default value</div> | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Nozzle glow

Adding a `glow` key will insert a "glow" template into the plume. This serves to provide a smooth transition between the plume and the inside of the engine bell, especially for plumes using dynamic shaders. It is recommended that a glow be added to all engine parts, regardless of whether the engine has an emissive.

The `glow` key takes values of two forms:

* `_<color>`, referencing one of the `waterfall-nozzle-glow-<color>-1` templates
* `ro-<name>`, referencing one of the `rowaterfall-glow-<name>` templates

*Setting this key to any other value will result in undefined behavior*.

You can reference the [Plume Templates](#plume-templates) section for the appearance of these glows.

By default, the length of the generated glow will be twice the nozzle diameter (which is computed as the average of the x and y `scale`s).

Glows that require more complicated configuration (ex. custom positioning) should be added manually using an `ExtraTemplate` node.

#### Fuel-based plume switching

ROWaterfall supports plume switching based on the engine's RFMEC configuration if B9PartSwitch is installed. Variants/subtypes can be declared using the `MainPlumeVariant` node (see above), and the template declared in the parent `ROWaterfall` node is considered the default variant.

In the absence of B9PartSwitch, the default variant will be used for all fuel types.

This node takes the following keys:

* `name`: Required; must be unique.
* `template`: Required.
* `position`, `rotation`, and `scale`: Optional; will inherit from the default variant if not set.
* `glowRecolor`: Optional; takes the same values as `glow`. Used to replace the glow color of the default variant. It only has an effect if the default variant already has a `glow` declared.

If B9PartSwitch is installed and there are `MainPlumeVariant`s present, ROWaterfall will produce a `ModuleB9PartSwitch` with `moduleID` `rowaterfallMainPlumeSwitch`. For each `MainPlumeVariant`, ROWaterfall will generate a `SUBTYPE` with the same `name` that switches the `TEMPLATE`s in the Waterfall module appropriately. It will also produce a default subtype with a `name` derived from its `template` (unless overridden using the `defaultMainPlumeVariantName` key in the parent `ROWaterfall` node).

Furthermore, ROWaterfall will set up `ModuleEngineConfigs`'s B9PS integration by setting the `b9psModuleID` key and assigning each `CONFIG` to use the default variant.

Note that `ExtraTemplate`s are *not* directly switchable using `MainPlumeVariant`; this must be done by [manually modifying the generated switcher](#modifying-effects-generated-by-rowaterfall).

**Each `ModuleEngineConfigs` `CONFIG` not using the default variant must specify the `name` of the variant to use with the `rowaterfallVariant` key.** (If a config does not set a variant, it will use the default variant as specified above.)

The below configuration gives the LR-87 engine a kerolox plume variant, activated when the LR87-AJ-3 and LR87-AJ-9-Kero configurations are selected:

```text
@PART[ROE-LR87]:BEFORE[ROWaterfall]:NEEDS[Waterfall]
{
    ROWaterfall
    {
        template = waterfall-hypergolic-aerozine50-lower-1
        audio = pump-fed-lr87
        position = 0,0,0.69
        rotation = 0, 0, 0
        scale = 0.85, 0.85, 0.85
        glow = _white

        ExtraTemplate
        {
            template = waterfall-hypergolic-vernier-upper-2
            transform = newThrustTransform
            position = 0,0,0.011
            rotation = 0, 0, 0
            scale = 0.9, 0.9, 0.8
        }

            scale = 2.05, 2.05, 2.05
            glowRecolor = _yellow
        }
    }

    @MODULE[ModuleEngineConfigs]:NEEDS[B9PartSwitch]
    {
        @CONFIG[LR87-AJ-3]
        {
            %rowaterfallVariant = kerolox
        }
        @CONFIG[LR87-AJ-9-Kero]
        {
            %rowaterfallVariant = kerolox
        }
        // ROWaterfall will set all other configs to use the default aerozine50 plume.
    }
}
```

### Plume Templates

In addition to the [templates provided by Waterfall](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/Waterfall/wiki/Included-Templates), ROWaterfall also ships a number of supplemental templates.

#### `rowaterfall-cold-gas-1`

(Unrealistic-looking) template modified from `waterfall-rcs-jet-1` for cold gas generic thrusters.

IMAGE: TODO

#### `rowaterfall-glow-` family

These effects are recolors of the glows shipped with Waterfall.

Currently provided colors:

* `cold-gas`: Dim white glow.
* `hydrolox-blue`: Less brightly cyan blue glow for upper-stage hydrolox engines.
* `hydrolox-red-blue`: Transitions from red at sea-level to blue in vacuum, for sea-level hydrolox plumes.
* `hypergolic-az50`: Yellow-orangish, for use specifically with aerozine50-NTO plumes.
* `hypergolic-white`: White, without a yellow tinge, for use with generic hypergolic/monopropellant plumes.
* `methalox-blue`
* `methalox-purple`
* `ntr`
* `pentaborane`: Fantastically toxic.
* `srm`: Bright yellow-white.

#### `rowaterfall-ntr-1`

Modified from `BDB_nuclear_PBR_vac` to be slightly more fanned-out and easier to place.

#### `rowaterfall-rcs-` family

A pack of recolored RCS plumes for different fuel types.

#### Templates from Bluedog Design Bureau

* `BDB_HTP_vernier`
* `BDB_HTP_vernierVac`
* `BDB_nuclear_PBR_sustainer_LOXaug`

### Audio Templates

ROWaterfall will generate audio effects using the default node names: `running`, `engage`, `disengage`, and `flameout`.

The following generic templates are available:

* `pressure-fed-1`
* `pump-fed-very-light-1`
* `pump-fed-light-1`
* `pump-fed-medium-1`
* `pump-fed-heavy-1`
* `pump-fed-very-heavy-1`
* `rcs-jet-1`

The series of `pump-fed` effects are increasingly crackly, based on sound effects from Rocket Sound Enhancement (shipped as part of Waterfall).

There are also the following specialized effects for use:

* `pump-fed-f1`, which is extra crackly and energetic.
* `pump-fed-gamma`
* `pump-fed-lr87`, with the real "whoop" startup sound.
* `pump-fed-raptor`, with real sound effects from SpaceX test footage.
* `pump-fed-stentor`

**An engine that uses a non-default running effect name will not have sound.** If this is the case, either set the running effect name to `running` or [manually rename](#modifying-effects-generated-by-rowaterfall) the generated `running` effect node.

### Using other effect providers in conjunction with ROWaterfall

RealPlume effects (`PLUME`, `PLUME_TEMPLATE`) and handwritten Waterfall configs (`ModuleWaterfallFX`) can be **added in the `:AFTER[ROWaterfall]` pass if they need to coexist with ROWaterfall**. If they are added any earlier, they will be deleted by ROWaterfall in `:FOR[ROWaterfall]`.

Alternatively, to force an existing Waterfall or RealPlume config to be kept, add the `rowaterfallKeep` key to it (the value does not matter).

Stock (including audio) effects can be added in `:AFTER[ROWaterfall]` *as long as they have a different name than [the ones used by ROWaterfall](#audio-templates)*. Otherwise, see [modifying effects generated by ROWaterfall](#modifying-effects-generated-by-rowaterfall).

### Configuring parts which already ship Waterfall configs

You can either choose to modify the existing handwritten configs to be the right size, or re-configure the part entirely with ROWaterfall.

### Modifying effects generated by ROWaterfall

**Warning:** This can be fragile; do so at your own risk.

Modifications to effects (`ModuleWaterfallFX` or `EFFECTS`) generated by ROWaterfall can be done in `:AFTER[zROWaterfall_99_Finalize]` or a later pass. Patches *should not* be added in passes between `zROWaterfall_00` and `zROWaterfall_99`. These are used internally by ROWaterfall and their behavior could change at any time.

The below example modifies an `ExtraTemplate` for the `kerolox` plume variant:

```text
@PART[ROE-LR87]:AFTER[zROWaterfall_99_Finalize]:NEEDS[Waterfall,B9PartSwitch]
{
    @MODULE[ModuleB9PartSwitch]:HAS[#moduleID[rowaterfallMainPlumeSwitch]]
    {
        @SUBTYPE[kerolox]
        {
            @MODULE
            {
                @DATA
                {
                    @TEMPLATE:HAS[#templateName[waterfall-hypergolic-vernier-upper-2]]
                    {
                        @templateName = waterfall-kerolox-vernier-2
                        @position = 0,0,0
                        @rotation = 0, 0, 0
                        @scale = 1.85, 1.85, 1.5
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The below example changes the running effect name to `rcs`:

```text
@PART[ROC-CSTSM]:AFTER[zROWaterfall_99_Finalize]:NEEDS[Waterfall]
{
    @EFFECTS
    {
        @running
        {
            |_ = rcs
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding templates to ROWaterfall

By convention, templates provided by ROWaterfall should have names beginning with `rowaterfall`.

Templates should be numbered starting from 1, with the exception of "specialty" templates. There should only be one canonical version of each "specialty" template (ex. the SSME plume). Art changes should be made to the existing version in a backwards-compatible way (ex. not changing the "base size" of the plume), such that the interpretation stays consistent across all parts using that template.

For easy placement and configuration, new templates should generally have a z-position of 0 and avoid using large values of `FadeIn`. This is to ensure that there is a clearly defined boundary to be matched to the nozzle and that the position of the base of the plume does not move when the plume is scaled.

All nozzle glows should have the same default position and size (that is, the visual size and position when `position`, `rotation`, and `scale` are all their default values) as the glows shipped with Waterfall. This is required for glow rescaling to work.

The [Waterfall wiki](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/Waterfall/wiki) contains more information on creating templates.

#### Specifying controllers

ROWaterfall manages the insertion of `CONTROLLER`s into the Waterfall module. By default, it will insert the three standard controllers for engine templates:

```text
CONTROLLER
{
    name = atmosphereDepth
    linkedTo = atmosphere_density
}
CONTROLLER
{
    name = throttle
    linkedTo = throttle
    engineID = #$/ROWaterfall/engineID$
}
CONTROLLER
{
    name = random
    linkedTo = random
    range = 0,1
}
```

and RCS controllers for RCS templates:

```text
CONTROLLER
{
    name = atmosphereDepth
    linkedTo = atmosphere_density
}
CONTROLLER
{
    name = rcs
    linkedTo = rcs
    thrusterTransformName = #$/ROWaterfall/transform$
}
```

If your template requires specialized controllers, specify them in `_Processor/90_controllers.cfg` by adding a new block to the existing ones (they should be sorted alphabetically):

```text
@MODULE[ModuleWaterfallFX]:HAS[@TEMPLATE:HAS[#__rowaterfall[mainPlume],#templateName[your-template-name]]]
{
    // At least one `CONTROLLER` node here.
}
```

Note that this block must go *before* the default catch-all block at the end.

#### Configuring glow resize

If the template is expected to be used with engines, you should configure it for glow resizing in `_Processor/39_glow-resize.cfg`. The algebraic manipulations will vary by plume (you can reference existing computations), but the result should be that the glow has the same diameter as the base of the plume and that its top surface coincides with the base of the plume. In other words, if the plume is made to fit the edge of the nozzle, the glow should fill the inside of the nozzle without clipping.
