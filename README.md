# Waterfall configs for Realism Overhaul mods (WIP)

Work-in-progress Waterfall configs for Realism Overhaul mods.

As it currently stands, Waterfall is a moving target that is still itself in heavy development. We always target the latest release of Waterfall, so **if something does not work, your first step should be to verify that you have updated ALL relevant mods**.

**Support requests and bug reports should be directed here, NOT to Waterfall, Realism Overhaul, or any other mods.**

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Please note that the latest version (as of 2021-04-16) moved several files. Delete the `GameData/ROEngines/Waterfall` and `GameData/RealismOverhaul/Waterfall_Configs` folders before updating.**

<!-- **These configurations are based on the git versions of Realism Overhaul (at least [`295cdb8`](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/commit/295cdb89d03d0fc0276e4b07f167f835be3cf206)) and ROEngines (at least [`03e06e2`](https://github.com/KSP-RO/ROEngines/commit/03e06e29ecfa751fc835ccdff10d483aee4f51a7)). Using the release (i.e., CKAN) versions of these mods will break certain plumes.** -->

1. **If you have not done so, update to the latest versions of RealismOverhaul (>= 13.0) and ROEngines (>= 1.7).**
2. **Install the latest version of [Waterfall](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/Waterfall).**
   * ROE-Waterfall and Waterfall are two separate things. ROE-Waterfall provides configurations for Realism Overhaul engines, Waterfall provides the effects themselves. ROE-Waterfall is to Waterfall as RealPlume-Stock is to RealPlume. *You need both.*
3. Download this package: Press the green button "Code" and click on "Download ZIP".
4. Unpack into `GameData` and *agree* to overwrite.
5. Launch the game.

If you prefer engine lights from Engine Lighting Relit instead of Waterfall, create an empty folder named `ROWaterfallNoEngineLight` under `GameData`.

The eventual goal is to merge this patchset into the relevant RO mods; this unconventional installation process is only temporary.

## Currently Configured Parts

Note: Due to technical limitations (see #1), only one plume can be provided at the moment for engines with switchable fuel configurations (ex. hypergolic and kerolox).

## `ROWaterfall` Technical Documentation

`ROWaterfall` is a set of ModuleManager patches used to easily apply Waterfall and audio effects to engines.

### Basic Usage

The minimal configuration for adding a Waterfall plume and sound effect is as follows:

```text
@PART[PartName]:BEFORE[ROWaterfall]:NEEDS[Waterfall]
{
    ROWaterfall
    {
        template = waterfall-kerolox-lower-4
        audio = pump-fed-medium-1
    }
}
```

**Note that the patch should be applied in the `:BEFORE[ROWaterfall]` pass.**

`ROWaterfall` will transform this patch into a `Module[ModuleWaterfallFX]` node and an `EFFECTS` node, removing existing effects (stock, RealPlume) as necessary. However, it is still possible to use RealPlume (or stock) effects in conjunction with `ROWaterfall` â€“ see below.

**Only one `ROWaterfall` node will be processed for a single part.** If more complex plumes are needed, extra `ModuleWaterfallFX`es can be added manually as usual; they can coexists with `ROWaterfall`.

### Configuration Options

An `ROWaterfall` node can contain the following keys and nodes:

| <div style='min-width: 9em;'>Key or node name</div> | Required | <div style='min-width: 6em;'>Default value</div> | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Here is an example using some of the optional configuration options:

```text
@PART[ROE-RD107]:BEFORE[ROWaterfall]:NEEDS[Waterfall]
{
    ROWaterfall
    {
        template = waterfall-kerolox-lower-1
        audio = pump-fed-heavy-1
        transform = RD-107A-MainFXTransform
        position = 0,0,0.48
        rotation = 0,0,0
        scale = 1.3,1.3,1.3
        glow = _yellow  // Expanding to `waterfall-nozzle-glow-yellow-1`.

        ExtraTemplate
        {
            template = waterfall-kerolox-vernier-2
            transform = RD-107A-VernierFXTransform
            position = 0,0,0.29
            rotation = 0,0,0
            scale = 2.5,2.5,2
        }
    }
}
```

### Plume Templates

In addition to the templates provided by Waterfall, `ROWaterfall` also ships a number of supplemental templates.

#### The `rowaterfall-glow-` family

These effects are recolors of the glows shipped with Waterfall.

Currently provided colors:

* `hydrolox-blue`: Less brightly cyan blue glow for upper-stage hydrolox engines.
* `hydrolox-red-blue`: Transitions from red at sea-level to blue in vacuum, for sea-level hydrolox plumes.
* `hypergolic-az50`: Yellow-orangish, for use specifically with aerozine50-NTO plumes.
* `hypergolic-white`: White, without a yellow tinge, for use with generic hypergolic/monopropellant plumes.
* `methalox-blue`
* `methalox-purple`
* `ntr`

From left to right: `hydrolox-blue`, `hydrolox-red-blue` at sea level, `hydrolox-red-blue` in vacuum, `hypergolic-az50`, `hypergolic-white`, `methalox-blue`, `methalox-purple`, `ntr`.

#### `rowaterfall-hypergolic-superdraco`

Orange hypergolic plume with prominent shock diamonds, inspired by SpaceX SuperDraco thrusters.

#### Templates from Bluedog Design Bureau

* `BDB_HTP_vernier`
* `BDB_HTP_vernierVac`
* `BDB_nuclear_PBR_vac`

### Audio Templates

`ROWaterfall` will generate audio effects using the default node names: `running`, `engage`, `disengage`, and `flameout`.

The following generic templates are available:

* `pressure-fed-1`
* `pump-fed-very-light-1`
* `pump-fed-light-1`
* `pump-fed-medium-1`
* `pump-fed-heavy-1`
* `pump-fed-very-heavy-1`
* `rcs-jet-1`

The series of `pump-fed` effects are increasingly crackly, based on sound effects from Rocket Sound Enhancement (shipped as part of Waterfall).

There are also the following specialized effects for use:

* `pump-fed-f1-1`, which is extra crackly and energetic.
* `pump-fed-gamma-1`
* `pump-fed-lr87-1`, with the real "whoop" startup sound.
* `pump-fed-raptor-1`, with real sound effects from SpaceX test footage.
* `pump-fed-stentor-1`

### Using RealPlume or stock effects in conjunction with Waterfall

RealPlume effects can be added in the `:AFTER[ROWaterfall]` pass if they need to coexist with `ROWaterfall`. If they are added any earlier, they will be deleted by `ROWaterfall` in `:FOR[ROWaterfall]`.

Stock (including audio) effects can be added in `:AFTER[ROWaterfall]` *as long as they have a different name than [the ones used by `ROWaterfall`](#audio-templates)*. Otherwise, see [modifying effects generated by `ROWaterfall`](#modifying-effects-generated-by-rowaterfall).

### Modifying effects generated by `ROWaterfall`

**Warning:** This is inherently fragile; do so at your own risk.

Modifications to effects (`ModuleWaterfallFX` or `EFFECTS`) generated by `ROWaterfall` can be done in `:AFTER[zROWaterfall_99_Finalize]` or a later pass. Patches *should not* be added in passes between `zROWaterfall_00` and `zROWaterfall_99`. These are used internally by `ROWaterfall` and their behavior could change at any time.

### Adding templates to `ROWaterfall`

By convention, templates provided by `ROWaterfall` should have names beginning with `rowaterfall`.

All nozzle glows should have the same default position and size (that is, the visual size and position when `position`, `rotation`, and `scale` are all their default values) as the glows shipped with Waterfall. This is required for glow rescaling to work.
